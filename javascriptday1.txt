
Introduction to JavaScript 

##  What is JavaScript ?

JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive.
It is a client-side language, which means it runs in the user's browser without requiring any
resources from the server. JavaScript is used alongside HTML and CSS to create dynamic 
web applications.
 
      Case-Sensitive :  JavaScript is case-sensitive, meaning myvariable and MYVARIABLE are different. 
      Semicolons :    semicolons can be used to terminate statements to avoid confusion. 


## Why Learn JavaScript?

JavaScript is the most widely-used language in web development.
It allows you to create interactive elements like buttons, forms, animations, etc.
It’s the foundation of front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.


## JavaScript Display  Content

     1. Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.

     2. Writing into the HTML output using document.write().

     3. Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().

     4. Writing into the browser console, using console.log().





## JavaScript Basics
              JavaScript is case-sensitive and supports the use of comments.

             Single-line comment: // This is a comment
             Multi-line comment: /* This is a multi-line comment */


##  How to Include JavaScript in HTML.   

          1) <script src="script.js"></script>

            2) <script>
                   Console.log("Hello World");
               </script>


##  Datatypes:

there are two types of data types in javascripts 

      1. primitive data types : undefined, null, number, Bigint, string, boolean 
      2. reference data types / Non- primitive data types : Arrays and Objects. 

## Variables:

Variables are used to store data. In modern JavaScript, use let and const, var also:


    let name = "John";        // Can be reassigned        
    const age = 25;           // Constant, cannot be reassigned, likes as final variable in java
    var address = "pune";     // Older versions used var, but it is less commonly used today due to issues with scoping.{}

console.log(name, age ,address);
